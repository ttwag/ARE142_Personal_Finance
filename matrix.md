# Annuity As a Matrix

## General Finance Definition

* **Money**: an financial asset whose real worth is changing with the period
* **Payment (PMT)**: a money added to an account or contract
* **Period**: here, a period is an integer point in time where the saving's worth is evaluated.

  0  1  2  3  4 ... n
  ```

* **Future Value ($FV_{j, k}$)**: the worth at period $k$ of a payment made at period $j$.
* **Present Value ($PV_j$)**: the worth at period 0 of a payment that is or will be made at period $j$.
* **Time Value of Money**: The worth of money is constantly changing

$$FV_{k + 1, j} = (FV_{k, j}) \times (1 + i_k) $$

## Future Value Matrix for Annuity

The future value could be thought of as a matrix, $FV_{i, j}$,

where $0 \leq k \leq n$ and  $0 \leq j \leq n$
